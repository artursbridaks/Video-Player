The app was built as an attempt to learn React and understand how it works. The project is relatively simple but introduced me to how React hooks work, how to pass down functions through props and more.

**To run the site:**

* Clone the app to your local machine
* Open the terminal from the project folder and enter:
    * Or open the Visual Studio Code inner terminal and enter:
* npm start 
* The browser should open automatically and the app will be ready to use

**Project Overview**

* Project is created on React library (commonly referred to as a framework)
* All the buttons and sliders work as they are supposed to
* Tried to implement the following concept - one function (component) per file
* Functions passed down through props
* Project also includes comment section - enter the name, your comment and submit it 
* The icons used are custom made SVG icons

**Improvements**

* Since it's my first project on React, there probably are a lot of improvements I could do
* The more complex the project become, the more I lost track of all the functions and where should those be placed, but I did my best
* Looking forward to implementing Redux into my future React apps
